function _tmux {
    _arguments \
        '-2[Force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours. This is equivalent to -T 256.]' \
        '-C[Start in control mode (see the CONTROL MODE section). Given twice (-CC) disables echo.]' \
        '-c[Execute shell-command using the default shell. If necessary, the tmux server will be started to retrieve the default-shell option. This option is for compatibility with sh(1) when tmux is used as a login shell.]' \
        '-D[Do not start the tmux server as a daemon. This also turns the exit-empty option off. With -D, command may not be specified.]' \
        '-f[Specify an alternative configuration file. By default, tmux loads the system configuration file from @SYSCONFDIR@/tmux.conf, if present, then looks for a user configuration file at ~/.tmux.conf, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf or ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf.]':file:_files \
        '-L[tmux stores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR or /tmp if it is unset. The default socket is named default. This option allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several independent tmux servers to be run. Unlike -S a full path is not necessary: the sockets are all created in a directory tmux-UID under the directory given by TMUX_TMPDIR or in /tmp. The tmux-UID directory is created by tmux and must not be world readable, writable or executable.]' \
        '-l[Behave as a login shell. This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.]' \
        '-N[Do not start the server even if the command would normally do so (for example new-session or start-server).]' \
        '-S[Specify a full alternative path to the server socket. If -S is specified, the default socket directory is not used and any -L flag is ignored.]':file:_files \
        '-u[Write UTF-8 output to the terminal even if the first environment variable of LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG that is set does not contain "UTF-8" or "UTF8". This is equivalent to -T UTF-8.]' \
        '-T[Set terminal features for the client. This is a comma-separated list of features. See the terminal-features option.]' \
        '-v[Request verbose logging. Log messages will be saved into tmux-client-PID.log and tmux-server-PID.log files in the current directory, where PID is the PID of the server or client process. If -v is specified twice, an additional tmux-out-PID.log file is generated with a copy of everything tmux writes to the terminal.]' \
        '-V[Report the tmux version.]' \
