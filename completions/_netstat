function _netstat {
    _arguments \
        {--route,-r}'[Display the kernel routing tables. See the description in route(8) for details. netstat -r and route -e produce the same output.]' \
        {--groups,-g}'[Display multicast group membership information for IPv4 and IPv6.]' \
        {--interfaces,-i}'[Display a table of all network interfaces.]' \
        {--masquerade,-M}'[Display a list of masqueraded connections.]' \
        {--statistics,-s}'[Display summary statistics for each protocol.]' \
        {--verbose,-v}'[Tell the user what is going on by being verbose. Especially print some useful information about unconfigured address families.]' \
        {--wide,-W}'[Do not truncate IP addresses by using output as wide as needed. This is optional for now to not break existing scripts.]' \
        {--numeric,-n}'[Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host, port or user names.]' \
        '--numeric-hosts[shows numerical host addresses but does not affect the resolution of port or user names.]' \
        '--numeric-ports[shows numerical port numbers but does not affect the resolution of host or user names.]' \
        '--numeric-users[shows numerical user IDs but does not affect the resolution of host or port names.]' \
        {--protocol,-A}'[Specifies the address families (perhaps better described as low level protocols) for which connections are to be shown. family is a comma ('\'','\'') separated list of address family keywords like inet, inet6, unix, ipx, ax25, netrom, econet, ddp, and bluetooth. This has the same effect as using the --inet|-4, --inet6|-6, --unix|-x, --ipx, --ax25, --netrom, --ddp, and --bluetooth options.]' \
        {-c,--continuous}'[This will cause netstat to print the selected information every second continuously.]' \
        {-e,--extend}'[Display additional information. Use this option twice for maximum detail.]' \
        {-o,--timers}'[Include information related to networking timers.]' \
        {-p,--program}'[Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.]' \
        {-l,--listening}'[Show only listening sockets. (These are omitted by default.)]' \
        {-a,--all}'[Show both listening and non-listening sockets. With the --interfaces option, show interfaces that are not up]' \
        '-F[Print routing information from the FIB. (This is the default.)]' \
        '-C[Print routing information from the route cache.]' \
