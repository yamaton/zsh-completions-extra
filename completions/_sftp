function _sftp {
    _arguments \
        '-4[Forces sftp to use IPv4 addresses only.]' \
        '-6[Forces sftp to use IPv6 addresses only.]' \
        '-A[Allows forwarding of ssh-agent(1) to the remote system. The default is not to forward an authentication agent.]' \
        '-B[Specify the size of the buffer that sftp uses when transferring files. Larger buffers require fewer round trips at the cost of higher memory consumption. The default is 32768 bytes.]' \
        '-b[Batch mode reads a series of commands from an input batchfile instead of stdin. Since it lacks user interaction it should be used in conjunction with non-interactive authentication to obviate the need to enter a password at connection time (see sshd(8) and ssh-keygen(1) for details).]':file:_files \
        '-C[Enables compression (via ssh'\''s -C flag).]' \
        '-c[Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfers. This option is directly passed to ssh(1).]' \
        '-D[Connect directly to a local sftp server (rather than via ssh(1)). This option may be useful in debugging the client and server.]':file:_files \
        '-F[Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh(1). This option is directly passed to ssh(1).]' \
        '-f[Requests that files be flushed to disk immediately after transfer. When uploading files, this feature is only enabled if the server implements the "fsync@openssh.com" extension.]' \
        '-i[Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read. This option is directly passed to ssh(1).]':file:_files \
        '-J[Connect to the target host by first making an sftp connection to the jump host described by destination and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there. Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters. This is a shortcut to specify a ProxyJump configuration directive. This option is directly passed to ssh(1).]' \
        '-l[Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.]' \
        '-N[Disables quiet mode, e.g. to override the implicit quiet mode set by the -b flag.]' \
        '-o[Can be used to pass options to ssh in the format used in ssh_config(5). This is useful for specifying options for which there is no separate sftp command-line flag. For example, to specify an alternate port use: sftp -oPort=24. For full details of the options listed below, and their possible values, see ssh_config(5).]' \
        '-P[Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.]' \
        '-p[Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original files transferred.]' \
        '-q[Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and diagnostic messages from ssh(1).]' \
        '-R[Specify how many requests may be outstanding at any one time. Increasing this may slightly improve file transfer speed but will increase memory usage. The default is 64 outstanding requests.]' \
        '-r[Recursively copy entire directories when uploading and downloading. Note that sftp does not follow symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.]' \
        '-S[Name of the program to use for the encrypted connection. The program must understand ssh(1) options.]' \
        '-s[Specifies the SSH2 subsystem or the path for an sftp server on the remote host. A path is useful when the remote sshd(8) does not have an sftp subsystem configured.]' \
        '-v[Raise logging level. This option is also passed to ssh.]' \
        '-1[Produce single columnar output.]' \
        '-a[List files beginning with a dot (‘.’).]' \
        '-f[Do not sort the listing. The default sort order is lexicographical.]' \
        '-h[When used with a long format option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, and Exabyte in order to reduce the number of digits to four or fewer using powers of 2 for sizes (K=1024, M=1048576, etc.).]' \
        '-l[Display additional details including permissions and ownership information.]' \
        '-n[Produce a long listing with user and group information presented numerically.]' \
        '-r[Reverse the sort order of the listing.]' \
        '-S[Sort the listing by file size.]' \
        '-t[Sort the listing by last modification time.]' \
