function _lsof {
    _arguments \
        {-?,-h}'[These two equivalent options select a usage (help) output list. Lsof displays a shortened form of this output when it detects an error in the options supplied to it, after it has displayed messages explaining each error. (Escape the `?'\'' character as your shell requires.)]' \
        '-a[causes list selection options to be ANDed, as described above.]' \
        '-A[is available on systems configured for AFS whose AFS kernel code is implemented via dynamic modules. It allows the lsof user to specify A as an alternate name list file where the kernel addresses of the dynamic modules might be found. See the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.) for more information about dynamic modules, their symbols, and how they affect lsof.]' \
        '-b[causes lsof to avoid kernel functions that might block - lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2).]' \
        '-c[selects the listing of files for processes executing the command that begins with the characters of c. Multiple commands may be specified, using multiple -c options. They are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.]' \
        '-C[disables the reporting of any path name components from the kernel'\''s name cache. See the KERNEL NAME CACHE section for more information.]' \
        '-d[specifies a list of file descriptors (FDs) to exclude from or include in the output listing. The file descriptors are specified in the comma-separated set s - e.g., ``cwd,1,3'\'''\'', ``^6,^2'\'''\''. (There should be no spaces in the set.)]' \
        '-D[directs lsof'\''s use of the device cache file. The use of this option is sometimes restricted. See the DEVICE CACHE FILE section and the sections that follow it for more information on this option.]' \
        '-F[specifies a character list, f, that selects the fields to be output for processing by another program, and the character that terminates each output field. Each field to be output is specified with a single character in f. The field terminator defaults to NL, but may be changed to NUL (000). See the OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section for a description of the field identification characters and the field output process.]' \
        '-g[excludes or selects the listing of files for the processes whose optional process group IDentification (PGID) numbers are in the comma-separated set s - e.g., ``123'\'''\'' or ``123,^456'\'''\''. (There should be no spaces in the set.)]' \
        '-i[selects the listing of files any of whose Internet address matches the address specified in i. If no address is specified, this option selects the listing of all Internet and x.25 (HP-UX) network files.]' \
        '-K[selects the listing of tasks (threads) of processes, on dialects where task (thread) reporting is supported. (If help output - i.e., the output of the -h or -? options - shows this option, then task (thread) reporting is supported by the dialect.)]' \
        '-k[specifies a kernel name list file, k, in place of /vmunix, /mach, etc. -k is not available under AIX on the IBM RISC/System 6000.]' \
        '-l[inhibits the conversion of user ID numbers to login names. It is also useful when login name lookup is working improperly or slowly.]' \
        '-n[inhibits the conversion of network numbers to host names for network files. Inhibiting conversion may make lsof run faster. It is also useful when host name lookup is not working properly.]' \
        '-N[selects the listing of NFS files.]' \
        '-o[defines the number of decimal digits (o) to be printed after the ``0t'\'''\'' for a file offset before the form is switched to ``0x...'\'''\''. An o value of zero (unlimited) directs lsof to use the ``0t'\'''\'' form for all offset output.]' \
        '-O[directs lsof to bypass the strategy it uses to avoid being blocked by some kernel operations - i.e., doing them in forked child processes. See the BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS and AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS sections for more information on kernel operations that may block lsof.]' \
        '-p[excludes or selects the listing of files for the processes whose optional process IDentification (PID) numbers are in the comma-separated set s - e.g., ``123'\'''\'' or ``123,^456'\'''\''. (There should be no spaces in the set.)]' \
        '-P[inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files. Inhibiting the conversion may make lsof run a little faster. It is also useful when port name lookup is not working properly.]' \
        '-R[directs lsof to list the Parent Process IDentification number in the PPID column.]' \
        '-s[s alone directs lsof to display file size at all times. It causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to be changed to SIZE. If the file does not have a size, nothing is displayed.]' \
        '-S[specifies an optional time-out seconds value for kernel functions - lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2) - that might otherwise deadlock. The minimum for t is two; the default, fifteen; when no value is specified, the default is used.]' \
        '-T[controls the reporting of some TCP/TPI information, also reported by netstat(1), following the network addresses. In normal output the information appears in parentheses, each item except TCP or TPI state name identified by a keyword, followed by `='\'', separated from others by a single space:]' \
        '-t[specifies that lsof should produce terse output with process identifiers only and no header - e.g., so that the output may be piped to kill(1). -t selects the -w option.]' \
        '-u[selects the listing of files for the user whose login names or user ID numbers are in the comma-separated set s - e.g., ``abe'\'''\'', or ``548,root'\'''\''. (There should be no spaces in the set.)]' \
        '-U[selects the listing of UNIX domain socket files.]' \
        '-v[selects the listing of lsof version information, including: revision number; when the lsof binary was constructed; who constructed the binary and where; the name of the compiler used to construct the lsof binary; the version number of the compiler when readily available; the compiler and loader flags used to construct the lsof binary; and system information, typically the output of uname'\''s -a option.]' \
        '-V[directs lsof to indicate the items it was asked to list and failed to find - command names, file names, Internet addresses or files, login names, NFS files, PIDs, PGIDs, and UIDs.]' \
        '-x[may accompany the +d and +D options to direct their processing to cross over symbolic links and|or file system mount points encountered when scanning the directory (+d) or directory tree (+D).]' \
        '-X[This is a dialect-specific option.]' \
        '-z[specifies how Solaris 10 and higher zone information is to be handled.]' \
        '-Z[specifies how SELinux security contexts are to be handled. It and '\''Z'\'' field output character support are inhibited when SELinux is disabled in the running Linux kernel. See OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS for more information on the '\''Z'\'' field output character.]' \
        '--[The double minus sign option is a marker that signals the end of the keyed options. It may be used, for example, when the first file name begins with a minus sign. It may also be used when the absence of a value for the last keyed option must be signified by the presence of a minus sign in the following option and before the start of the file names.]' \
