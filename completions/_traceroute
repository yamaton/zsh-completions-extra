        '-n[Do not resolve IP addresses to their domain names]' \
        {-p,--port}'[Set the destination port to use. It is either initial udp port value for "default" method (incremented by each probe, default is 33434), or initial seq for "icmp" (incremented as well, default from 1), or some constant destination port for other methods (with default of 80 for "tcp", 53 for "udp", etc.)]' \

        {-w,--wait}'[Wait for a probe no more than HERE (default 3) times longer than a response from the same hop, or no more than NEAR (default 10) times than some next hop, or MAX (default 5.0) seconds (float point values allowed too)]' \

        {-s,--source}'[Use source src_addr for outgoing packets]' \

        {-M,--module}'[Use specified module (either builtin or external) for traceroute operations. Most methods have their shortcuts (`-I'\'' means `-M icmp'\'' etc.)]' \
        {-O,--options}'[Use module-specific option OPTS for the traceroute module. Several OPTS allowed, separated by comma. If OPTS is "help", print info about available options]' \
        '--sport[Use source port num for outgoing packets. Implies `-N 1'\'']' \
        '--fwmark[Set firewall mark for outgoing packets]' \
        {-U,--udp}'[Use UDP to particular port for tracerouting (instead of increasing the port per each probe), default port is 53]' \
        '-UL[Use UDPLITE for tracerouting (default dest port is 53)]' \
        {-D,--dccp}'[Use DCCP Request for tracerouting (default port is 33434)]' \
